Kerala Flood Analysis Project
- Overview
  
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of Kerala floods, focusing on annual rainfall, monthly variations, and the occurrence of floods. The project involves various stages such as data cleaning, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and visualization using Power BI.

- Project Structure

  
Data Cleaning: The project starts with cleaning the raw data, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data integrity.

Data Wrangling: Transformation and preparation of the data for analysis, including feature engineering and formatting for machine learning.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Comprehensive exploration of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to annual rainfall, monthly variations, and flood occurrences.

Machine Learning: Application of machine learning techniques to predict and analyze flood occurrences based on historical data. This involves model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

Power BI Visualization: Utilization of Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards showcasing key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
